On the Duty of C++ Debugging

by Adam Kaplan

I heartily accept the motto, "That source code is best
which builds cleanest"; and I should like to see students
carry this out in this class.  Carried out, it finally
amounts to this, which also I believe--"That source code is
best which builds with no warnings nor errors"; and when 
Visual Studio is prepared for it, that will be the kind of code
which it will have.  Debug-output is at best but an expedient; 
but most bugs are usually, and all bugs are sometimes, inexpedient.
The objections which I have to poor code are many
and will be upheld via poor grades on assignments which fail
to build correctly.
The standing army is only an arm of the standing government.
The executable itself, which is ideally the only thing I need
to test for correctness, is equally liable to be poorly built
and corrupted before the TAs can test through it.  Witness the
present Project grading, the work of comparatively few hours
using the Visual Studio .NET as my tool; for in the outset,
the people would not have consented to this measure.
